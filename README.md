# railtemp

[![Python application](https://github.com/aryvini/railtemp/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/aryvini/railtemp/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)



Module to simulate railway temperatures based on weather parameters, such as: wind velocity, air temperature and solar radiation.

## Instalation

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/aryvini/railtemp.git
```

## About
The code presented here is subjected of a Master Thesis work developed at [Instituto Politécnico de Bragança - Portugal](http://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/). Detailed publication is available [here](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/handle/10198/23684). The research is based on a previous model developed by Chungnam National University, that can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12541-019-00015-1).

The purpose of the code is to facilitate the process of simulate/calculate a heat transfer equation varying many parameters such as: geolocation, profile, physical aspects and more. Therefore this module abstract the process of solving into some easy classes' methods.

Examples are available [here](./examples/).
