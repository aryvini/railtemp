# railtemp

Module to simulate railway temperatures based on weather parameters, such as: wind velocity, air temperature and solar radiation.

The code presented here is subjected of a Master Thesis work developed at [Instituto Politécnico de Bragança - Portugal](http://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/). Detailed publication is available [here](https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/handle/10198/23684). The research is based on a previous model developed by Chungnam National University, that can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12541-019-00015-1).  

The purpose of the code is to facilitate the process of simulate/calculate a heat transfer equation varying many parameters such as: geolocation, profile, physical aspects and more. Therefore this module abstract the process of solving into some easy classes' methods. A example of usage is available [here](example/example.ipynb).
